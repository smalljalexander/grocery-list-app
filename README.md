# How It's Made
<b>Tech used:</b> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS and MongoDB
The Grocery List is a CRUD web app where you can add items to the list, cross them off when you get them and delete the list after your done shopping. I used EJS to put the data of the items into the DOM from the MongoDB database.  I used express and Node.js to create the backend server.

# Optimizations
I  want to fix if there is two of the same item the app will always cross out the lowest item on the list. I would fix this by using the database Id on the item.
Add authentication features to have different users have their own grocery list
Update the web app to the MVC model. 


# Lessons Learned
I learned how to use ejs to add data into html. I have JavaScript functions attached to click events used to trigger events in the dom.  I used MongoDB and learned how using a database to define the properties in the database collection.
